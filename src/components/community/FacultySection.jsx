Each year, the School engages Teaching Fellows enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania's Boarding School Teacher Residency program, in which they work toward a master's degree in education. Teaching Fellows teach in an academic department, live on campus, and fully participate in the residential and co-curricular life of the School. By doing so, they not only bring their fresh perspective to the Lawrenceville experience, they also learn from our experienced teaching and subject-matter experts.",
