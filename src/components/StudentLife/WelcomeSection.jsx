              Developing a positive and welcoming environment gives students the
              courage to participate in true Harkness discussion in class and in
              life. Every learning experience at Pamavambo is a deliberate and
              consistent effort to create a sense of belonging and affirmation
              for each and every student.
            </p>

            <p>
              Along with that foundation of inclusion comes the expectation that
              each student will be fully involved and engaged, maintaining a
              high degree of ownership and participation. Students teach each
              other through shared experience, varying perspectives, and a
              mutual accountability that encourages tenacity and resilience
              paired with empathy and compassionate objectivity. Every class and
              every conversation is enriched by the ever-increasing knowledge
              and aptitude of its members.
            </p>

            <p>
              As students see that learning happens in all environments and
              applies to every part of life, they embrace the academic rigor
              setting them on a path to a life of meaningful and rich
              relationships as driven, critical citizens.
