It is unlikely that a family's aid eligibility will change unless there is a significant change in their circumstances such as job loss, additional tuition expenses for other children, or the death of a parent. Families who come to Lawrenceville as full-pay, should expect to be full-pay throughout their time at the School barring any significant life event such as previously described.",
