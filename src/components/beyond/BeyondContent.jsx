          Whether connecting with the land at the Big Red Farm, deepening their
          understanding of world cultures, or embarking on a trip abroad,
          Pamavambo students know there's no limit to what they can learn.

          Experiential learning allows students to witness the real-life
          application of their studies during the school day. In addition to
          lending a sense of closure to theoretical learning, these experiences
          offer students a legitimate opportunity to learn from failure — and
          feel validation from success — in a way that isn't possible in
          classroom learning.
